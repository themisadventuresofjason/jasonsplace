<h1>STARBALLZ</h1> 
<p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> Starballz is a very "interesting" movie that first got released into the public at </p>
  <p>somepoint after June 27, 2001. The general idea of the film is basically a hentai parody of </p>
  <p>Starwars featuring a variety of characters from different anime. </p> <img src="/jasonsplace/starballz1.gif" align="right" > 
  <p>Personally I felt the movie was shitty but in a good way, and no im NOT giving it a mild thumbs up</p>
  <p>because of titties bouncing, I sorta like this film because it just is pretty funny to me. I liked some of</p>
  <p>the stupid one-liners in it and other aspects of it aswell but those are the only redeeming parts of the movie.</p>
  <p>My problems come in with the animation which is mostly good but sometimes it looks a bit goofy or is just a</p>
  <p>bunch of low effort loops and shit and the music comes off as kinda bad sometimes but it does sound good in</p>
  <p>some certain parts.</p> <img src="/jasonsplace/starballz2.gif" align="right" >

  <p>In conclusion, I give this "masterpiece" a 4/10 personally. </p>
